I am a fifth-year CS Ph.D. candidate at the University of Maryland’s [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page), advised by [Wei Ai](https://aiwei.me/).
My research interests are Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Social Science.
I am interested in uncovering patterns from data and investigate how these patterns correlate with human behaviors, particularly in education and social media contexts.
I also study how such patterns influence the behaviors of language models.
At UMD, I also closely work with [Jing Liu](https://www.jingliu.info/), [Louiqa Raschid](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~louiqa/), [Vanessa Frias-Martinez](https://vanessafriasmartinez.umiacs.io/), and [Furong Huang](https://furong-huang.com/).

In the past, I have interned at Adobe Research. Previously, I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with M.S.E in Computer Science, where I worked with [Mark Dredze](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/) at [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/).
I obtained my B.E in Computer Science from Southwest University, where I worked with [Yong Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zuhod6sAAAAJ&hl=en) on Complex Network, and [Tao Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MXgWgmEAAAAJ&hl=en) on Human Mobility.
