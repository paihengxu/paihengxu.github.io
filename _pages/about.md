I am a third-year CS Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland’s [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page), advised by [Wei Ai](https://aiwei.me/). My research interests are Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science. I am interested in understanding human communications in various contexts by developing NLP tools that are explainable, causal, and fair. Currently, I am working on identifying equity-centered teaching practices in the classroom and effective messaging strategies for public health on social media.

In the past, I have interned at Adobe Research. Previously, I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with M.S.E in Computer Science, where I worked with [Mark Dredze](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/) at [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/). I obtained my B.E in Computer Science from Southwest University, where I worked with [Yong Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zuhod6sAAAAJ&hl=en) on Complex Network, and [Tao Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MXgWgmEAAAAJ&hl=en) on Human Mobility.
