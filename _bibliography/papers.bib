  abstract={Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks.}

  abstract={A common use of NLP is to facilitate the understanding of large document collections, with models based on Large Language Models (LLMs) replacing probabilistic topic models. Yet the effectiveness of LLM-based approaches in real-world applications remains under explored. This study measures the knowledge users acquire with topic models—including traditional, unsupervised and supervised LLM- based approaches—on two datasets. While LLM-based methods generate more human- readable topics and show higher average win probabilities than traditional models for data exploration, they produce overly generic topics for domain-specific datasets that do not easily allow users to learn much about the documents. Adding human supervision to LLM-based topic models improves data exploration by addressing hallucination and genericity but requires more human efforts. In contrast, traditional models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) remain effective for exploration but are less user-friendly. This paper provides best practices—there is no one right model, the choice of models is situation-specific—and suggests potential improvements for scalable LLM-based topic models.}

  abstract={Scripting interfaces enable users to automate tasks and customize software workflows, but creating scripts traditionally requires programming expertise and familiarity with specific APIs, posing barriers for many users. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code from natural language queries, runtime code generation is severely limited due to unverified code, security risks, longer response times, and higher computational costs. To bridge the gap, we propose an offline simulation framework to curate a software-specific skillset, a collection of verified scripts, by exploiting LLMs and publicly available scripting guides. Our framework comprises two components: (1) task creation, using top-down functionality guidance and bottom-up API synergy exploration to generate helpful tasks; and (2) skill generation with trials, refining and validating scripts based on execution feedback. To efficiently navigate the extensive API landscape, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based link prediction model to capture API synergy, enabling the generation of skills involving underutilized APIs and expanding the skillset's diversity. Experiments with Adobe Illustrator demonstrate that our framework significantly improves automation success rates, reduces response time, and saves runtime token costs compared to traditional runtime code generation. This is the first attempt to use software scripting interfaces as a testbed for LLM-based systems, highlighting the advantages of leveraging execution feedback in a controlled environment and offering valuable insights into aligning AI capabilities with user needs in specialized software domains.}

Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution, enabling the transfer of capabilities from larger teacher LLMs to more compact student models. Particularly, sequence-level KD, which distills rationale-based reasoning processes instead of merely final outcomes, shows great potential in enhancing students' reasoning capabilities. However, current methods struggle with sequence-level KD under long-tailed data distributions, adversely affecting generalization on sparsely represented domains. We introduce the Multi-Stage Balanced Distillation (BalDistill) framework, which iteratively balances training data within a fixed computational budget. By dynamically selecting representative head domain examples and synthesizing tail domain examples, BalDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse long-tailed datasets, enhancing both the efficiency and efficacy of the distilled models."

  abstract={Social media platforms like Twitter (now X) have been pivotal in information dissemination and public engagement, especially during COVID-19. A key goal for public health experts was to encourage prosocial behavior that could impact local outcomes such as masking and social distancing. Given the importance of local news and guidance during COVID-19, the objective of our research is to analyze the effect of localized engagement, on social media conversations. This study examines the impact of geographic co-location, as a proxy for localized engagement between public health experts (PHEs) and the public, on social media. We analyze a Twitter conversation dataset from January 2020 to November 2021, comprising over 19 K tweets from nearly five hundred PHEs, along with approximately 800 K replies from 350 K participants. Our findings reveal that geo-co-location is associated with higher engagement rates, especially in conversations on topics including masking, lockdowns, and education, and in conversations with academic and medical professionals. Lexical features associated with emotion and personal experiences were more common in geo-co-located contexts. This research provides insights into how geographic co-location influences social media engagement and can inform strategies to improve public health messaging.}

The emergence of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various NLP domains, particularly through their advanced reasoning capabilities. This survey focuses on evaluating and improving LLMs from a causal view in the following areas: understanding and improving the LLMs' reasoning capacity, addressing fairness and safety issues in LLMs, complementing LLMs with explanations, and handling multimodality. Meanwhile, LLMs' strong reasoning capacities can in turn contribute to the field of causal inference by aiding causal relationship discovery and causal effect estimations. This review explores the interplay between causal inference frameworks and LLMs from both perspectives, emphasizing their collective potential to further the development of more advanced and equitable artificial intelligence systems.}

  abstract={Analyzing time series from the perspective of complex network has interested many scientists. In this paper, based on visibility graph theory a novel method of constructing weighted complex network from time series is proposed. The first step is to determine the weights of vertices in time series, which linearly combines the weights generated by induced ordered averaging aggregation operator (IOWA) and visibility graph aggregation operator (VGA). Then, two strategies, averaging strategy and gravity strategy, are proposed to construct weighted network. To testify the validity of proposed method, an artificial case is adopted, in which link prediction is used to evaluate the performance of the weighted network. It is shown that the weighted network constructed by proposed method greatly outperforms the unweighted network obtained by traditional visibility graph theory.}

  abstract={The method to estimate the predictability of human mobility was proposed in Song et al. (2010), which is extensively followed in exploring the predictability of disparate time series. However, the ambiguous description in the original paper leads to some misunderstandings, including the inconsistent logarithm bases in the entropy estimator and the entropy-predictability-conversion equation, as well as the details in the calculation of the Lempel–Ziv estimator, which further results in remarkably overestimated predictability. This paper demonstrates the degree of overestimation by four different types of theoretically generated time series and an empirical data set, and shows the intrinsic deviation of the Lempel–Ziv estimator for highly random time series. This work provides a clear picture on this issue and thus helps researchers in correctly estimating the predictability of time series.}

Since demographics are unavailable on many social media platforms (e.g. Twitter) numerous studies have inferred demographics automatically. Despite many studies presenting proof of concept inference of race and ethnicity, training of practical systems remains elusive since there are few annotated datasets. Existing datasets are small, inaccurate, or fail to cover the four most common racial and ethnic groups in the United States. We present a method to identify self-reports of race and ethnicity from Twitter profile descriptions. Despite errors inherent in automated supervision, we produce models with good performance when measured on gold standard self-report survey data. The result is a reproducible method for creating large-scale training resources for race and ethnicity.}

However, traditional manual assessments are expensive, subjective, and heavily dependent on observers{'} expertise and idiosyncratic factors, preventing teachers from getting timely and frequent feedback. Different from prior research that mostly focuses on low-inference instructional practices on a singular basis, this paper presents the first study that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assess multiple high-inference instructional practices in two distinct educational settings: in-person K-12 classrooms and simulated performance tasks for pre-service teachers. This is also the first study that applies NLP to measure a teaching practice that is widely acknowledged to be particularly effective for students with special needs. We confront two challenges inherent in NLP-based instructional analysis, including noisy and long input data and highly skewed distributions of human ratings. Our results suggest that pretrained Language Models (PLMs) demonstrate performances comparable to the agreement level of human raters for variables that are more discrete and require lower inference, but their efficacy diminishes with more complex teaching practices. Interestingly, using only teachers{'} utterances as input yields strong results for student-centered variables, alleviating common concerns over the difficulty of collecting and transcribing high-quality student speech data in in-person teaching settings. Our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of current NLP techniques in the education domain, opening avenues for further exploration.",

While many existing studies improve fairness at the group level, only a few works promote individual fairness, which renders similar outcomes for similar individuals. A desirable framework that promotes individual fairness should (1) balance between fairness and performance, (2) accommodate two commonly-used individual similarity measures (externally annotated and computed from input features), (3) generalize across various GNN models, and (4) be computationally efficient. Unfortunately, none of the prior work achieves all the desirables. In this work, we propose a novel method, GFairHint, which promotes individual fairness in GNNs and achieves all aforementioned desirables. GFairHint learns fairness representations through an auxiliary link prediction task, and then concatenates the representations with the learned node embeddings in original GNNs as a "fairness hint". Through extensive experimental investigations on five real-world graph datasets under three prevalent GNN models covering both individual similarity measures above, GFairHint achieves the best fairness results in almost all combinations of datasets with various backbone models, while generating comparable utility results, with much less computational cost compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) method.}

Previous research has primarily concentrated on word, phrase, and syntax features, neglecting the concept level, often due to the absence of concept labels and difficulty in identifying conceptual content in input texts. This paper introduces two main contributions. First, we employ ChatGPT to assign concept labels to texts, assessing concept bias in models during fine-tuning or ICL on test data. We find that LMs, when encountering spurious correlations between a concept and a label in training or prompts, resort to shortcuts for predictions. Second, we introduce a data rebalancing technique that incorporates ChatGPT-generated counterfactual data, thereby balancing label distribution and mitigating spurious correlations.

First, researchers typically rely on crowd-sourcing to annotate emojis in order to understand their sentiments, usage intentions, and semantic meanings. Second, subjective interpretations by users can often lead to misunderstandings of emojis and cause the communication barrier.

We analyze correlations between demographic and political affiliation with reductions in physical mobility measured by public geolocation tweets. We find significant differences in mobility reduction between these groups in the United States.
